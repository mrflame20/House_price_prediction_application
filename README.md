## General info
I developed and evaluated the performance and the predictive power  of a model trained and tested on data collected from different sources.This application takes different decisive parameters as input and estimates the price based on those as output.

## Abstract
Normally house price is decided based on negotiation between seller and buyer. But there is a better way to decide the price. There are many factors which affect the price.For example, locality, price in that locality, availability of transport, availability of healthcare nearby, distance from schools, offices, etc. In the US, nowadays there is a trend
to use algorithms to decide the price of a house. There is a need for a Machine Learning algorithm that takes input of different decisive parameters and gives the estimated price.

## Technologies
